# Testes_LangChain_MentesNotaveis
2 Langchain libraries examples of using, with LangGraph, Groq, Chains, and JSON files  
The "Test1_LangChain.ipynb" is a simple chain using, like is commented in the documment, the system make a basic validation to make sure that is a math question(The focus of the system), and push a question to a json file, after, the json file is called again, for the model processing. The using of the system can be done by calling the main function, and passing the answer.
The "Test2_LangChain.ipynb" is a little bit complex in terms of code, because the system is based on LangGraph's Supervisor using, that include tools, nodes, and graphs. The system makes a 2 step process with llm models, using the "llama-3.1-8b-instant" the hole system is based on the route control by the Supervisor LLM, that is instructed to detect math terms and symbols, than pass the question to a agent instructed to respond as a Math Teacher. The system can be used only by the last cell actioning, that provides the question to the hole graph. 
Examples of using inclunding input and output are already in the files.
